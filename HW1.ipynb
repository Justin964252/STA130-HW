    "(1)Example of a Use Case for df.dropna() Over del df['col']:\n",
    "Use case: When you want to delete rows that are missing data in some but not all columns. and maintain as many data sets as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "Situation: You are working with a data set in which most of the columns contain useful information. But there are some rows that have missing values. For example, comments in a dataset about customer feedback may occasionally miss values. But deleting the entire column will result in the loss of important data...\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use df.dropna() : This method deletes only missing rows. The remaining data will be recorded in another row.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(2)Example of a Use Case for del df['col'] Over df.dropna():\n",
    "Use case: When an entire column is not relevant or there are too many missing values. This makes it unreliable or unnecessary for analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Scenario: Let's say you're working with a data set where more than 70% of values are missing in a column, such as Age. In this case, deleting the entire stack may be more efficient than dropping rows. This is because collecting the stack adds little value.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why use del df['col']: Maximum rows can be preserved by removing columns. Emphasis is placed on more reliable columns. and make the dataset as large as possible.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(3)Why Applying del df['col'] Before df.dropna() Might Be Important:\n",
    "If a column has a high percentage of missing values, use del df['col'] first to ensure that rows are not unnecessarily discarded just because of this column. Deleting that column will save additional rows when df.dropna() is later used to delete rows based on missing values in other columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's say a data set has 10 columns and one column (age) has 80% missing values. If you use df.dropna() first, you may delete up to 80% of the rows.\n",
    "But if you delete the age first The other columns will be saved. and maintain more lines\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "(4)Removing Missing Data from a Dataset (Before and After Report):\n",
    "Reason for the guideline:\n",
    "Step 1: Delete the Deck column because it does not contain multiple values. This makes it largely unreliable for analysis. First, remove this column and ensure that valid rows in other columns are not unnecessarily discarded.\n",
    "\n",
    "Step 2: Use df.dropna() to check for missing rows in other columns (such as age or activity). This helps ensure that we only keep rows that have complete data. This makes the analysis more reliable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before and after report:\n",
    "Previous: Titanic dataset has 891 rows and 15 columns\n",
    "Next: By deleting deck columns and dropping rows with missing values The dataset can be reduced to approximately 712 rows and 14 columns (this is an approximation based on the general format in the Titanic dataset).\n",

    "\n",
    "We discussed how the groupby() function groups the DataFrame by a specific column (col1) and then applies describe() to another column (col2) to get summary statistics (like count, mean, standard deviation) for each group.\n",

    "Difference Between df.describe() and df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe():\n",
    "\n",
    "df.describe() gives a summary of non-null values for each column across the entire dataset, while df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() provides a breakdown of summary statistics within each group formed by col1.\n",
    "Using the Titanic dataset as an example, we compared the overall statistics for age versus the group-specific statistics for age grouped by passenger class.\n",

    "We discussed how df.groupby(\"col1\")[\"col2\"].describe() groups a DataFrame by col1 and provides descriptive statistics for col2 within each group. The describe() function includes statistics such as count, mean, standard deviation, min, and percentiles.\n",
